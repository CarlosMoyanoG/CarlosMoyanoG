## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Carlos Moyano Guevara, a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong focus on **backend development, database-driven systems, and API-based architectures**.

I have hands-on experience designing and building **RESTful APIs**, developing backend services using **FastAPI, Spring Boot, and WildFly**, and integrating them with **Angular frontends**. I work extensively with **PostgreSQL**, focusing on schema design, query optimization, and data integrity, and I also use **Redis** for caching and performance improvement.

I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end: from data modeling and backend logic to integration and documentation. I work fluently in **English** in technical environments, including documentation, meetings, and collaboration.
